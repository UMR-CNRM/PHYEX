! Pointer of fields in microphysic species arrays. Microphysics species are
! usually counted as KRR=6 or KRR=7.
INTEGER, PARAMETER :: & ! pointer of fields in microphysic species arrays :
      & IRV=1,     & ! Water vapor
      & IRC=2,     & ! Cloud water
      & IRR=3,     & ! Rain water
      & IRI=4,     & ! Pristine ice

      & IRG=6,     & ! Graupel
      & IRH=7        ! Hail

! Pointers for tendency arrays
! Tendencies are computed either directly as a tendency or as a mixing ratio change that is transformed, afterwards, in a tendency
! The second type is suffixed by _MR
! Some final tendencies can have two contributions (one from a tendency, one from a mixing ratio change).
! In the following list, order matters:
! - first are the normal tendencies directly computed as tendencies
! - second are the tendencies computed only from a mixing ratio change
! - third are the indexes used to designate the mising ratio change part of double-contribution tendencies
